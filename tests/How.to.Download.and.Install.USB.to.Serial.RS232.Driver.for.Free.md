## What is USB to Serial RS232 Driver?

Serial ports are often used for devices such as modems, scanners, printers, barcode readers, GPS receivers, and industrial equipment.
  
However, most modern computers do not have a dedicated serial port. Instead, they use USB ports, which are faster and more versatile. USB ports can transmit data in parallel, using multiple wires. USB ports can also support various types of devices, such as keyboards, mice, flash drives, cameras, and speakers.
  
To connect a serial device to a USB port, you need a USB to serial RS232 adapter. This is a hardware device that converts the signals between the two interfaces. However, you also need a USB to serial RS232 driver to make the adapter work. This is because the operating system does not recognize the adapter as a serial port by default. The driver acts as a bridge between the operating system and the adapter, allowing them to exchange data.
